# SimpleFlax

SimpleFlax is a mod adding a single plant to the game: Flax. Flax is a 2-block tall crop that allows a player to obtain string without resorting to killing spiders, enabling mass farming of string without destroying performance.

To begin, destroy tall grass until you find Flax Seeds. From there, it can be farmed just like a normal crop. Have fun with loads of string!

This is based on the flax plant from RedPower 2, created by Eloraam. While effort has been taken to mimic the original rendition found in the mod, no code or art been copied. However, she does deserve credit for the idea to make a string plant.
